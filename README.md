# 🛠️ CTF Tools Collection

Welcome to my collection of tools used during Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions & Pentesting. Over time, I’ve gathered and refined a set of utilities, scripts, and frameworks that help tackle a wide range of CTF challenges, including binary exploitation, cryptography, web vulnerabilities, reverse engineering, forensics, OSINT, and more.

CTFs are a fantastic way to practice and improve cybersecurity skills in a practical, hands-on environment. Having the right tools can make a huge difference in efficiency and success. This repository is intended to be a comprehensive and organized reference for both newcomers and seasoned players who want quick access to reliable tools for each category.
