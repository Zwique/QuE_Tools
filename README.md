# üõ†Ô∏è CTF Tools Collection

Welcome to my curated collection of tools used during Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Over time, I‚Äôve gathered and refined a set of utilities, scripts, and frameworks that help tackle a wide range of CTF challenges, including binary exploitation, cryptography, web vulnerabilities, reverse engineering, forensics, OSINT, and more.

CTFs are a fantastic way to practice and improve cybersecurity skills in a practical, hands-on environment. Having the right tools can make a huge difference in efficiency and success. This repository is intended to be a comprehensive and organized reference for both newcomers and seasoned players who want quick access to reliable tools for each category.

## What You‚Äôll Find Here

- **Machine**: Tools for exploiting and interacting with vulnerable machines  
- **Cryptography**: Utilities for encrypting, decrypting, and analyzing ciphers  
- **Reverse Engineering & Forensics**: Frameworks for binary and malware analysis, along with tools for file, memory, and network investigation  
- **Web**: Scanners and proxies used to discover and exploit web vulnerabilities  
- **OSINT**: Resources for reconnaissance and open-source information gathering  
- **PWN**: Exploitation tools and techniques for binary-based challenges  


## How to Use This Repo

Each category contains a list of tools with brief descriptions and links to official sources or repositories. I continuously update this list as I discover new tools or find better alternatives. Contributions are always welcome!

Whether you want to prepare for your next CTF event or just expand your cybersecurity toolkit, this collection can help you get started or level up your game.
